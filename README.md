with Basecamp directly from R.

## Installation

To use this package clone the repository and install locally

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(basecamper)
```

Set up the TOKEN and HOST

You can find your TOKEN by logging into Basecamp

  - Click on `My info` found in the top right corner of the website
  - At the bottom of this page you will see `Authentication tokens`,
    click on `Show your tokens`
  - Copy the `Token for feed readers or the Basecamp API`, this goes
    into the `BASECAMP_TOKEN` environment variable.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
Sys.setenv(BASECAMP_TOKEN = 'MYTOKEN')
Sys.setenv(BASECAMP_HOST  = 'https://metrumresearchgroup.basecamphq.com')
```

### Whoami

Lets just check that the token and host are set right and get back your
account info

``` r
basecamper::whoami()
